# openzw-dot-net
A fully managed .NET port of the [OpenZWave library](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave). 

The goal of this project is to create a fully managed port of OpenZWave instead of relying on interop to an unmanaged DLL. This is a complete rewrite of OpenZWave, with a refactor to take full advantage of C# and adopt the code to follow C# practices (instead of unmanaged style code and practices in C#).

Definitely looking for some help to get this off the ground so if you're interested and have a device, feel free to submit a pull request!
